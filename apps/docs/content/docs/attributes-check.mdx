## Attributes Check

Puedo uses attributes check to determine if a user has access to a resource.

## Accessor key

Puedo defines `accessorKey` within its options. This key is used to access the first level of the permission object.

```ts
const permissions = {
    read: false,
};

const roles = [
	{
		id: "admin", // Expected value of the accessor key
		permissions: {
            read: true
        },
	},
];

const puedo = new Puedo({
	accessorKey: "role",
	permissions,
    roles,
});
```

If we do so, we expect the user to have a `role` attribute which is the main discriminator of the permissions.

```ts
const user = {
	name: "John Doe",
	role: "admin", // This is the attribute that accessorKey will access
};

const canRead = puedo.can(user, "read");
```

## More attributes

Puedo also supports mulitple attributes check. In order to do so, we can just use a function instead of a boolean within roles permissions.
Given a user made like this:

```ts
const user = {
	name: "John Doe",
	role: "admin",
    isEditor: true
};
```

We can define roles like this:
```ts
const roles = [
	{
		id: "admin",
		permissions: {
            read: (user) => user.isEditor
        },
	},
];
```

Now, if we try to check if the user has access to read, it will check if the user is an editor.

```ts
const canRead = puedo.can(user, "read") // true
```
